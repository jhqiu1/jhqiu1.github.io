Hello, I am Junhao Qiu, a Phd student in [Optima Group](https://optima.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Qingfu Zhang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html).

I completed my master’s (**recommended for exemption from examination**) and bachelor’s degrees at Guangdong University of Technology supervised by [Prof. Jianjun Liu](https://jdgcxy.gdut.edu.cn/info/1099/2006.htm).

I am currently interested in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, Multi-objective Optimization, Neural Combinatorial Optimization and Artificial Intelligence. 

For more information, you can visit my google scholar , ResearchGate, and Github
